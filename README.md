# lab_measurements_and_symptoms_combining
Simple project which merges three geological data tables, by range to range correlation. Goal is to impute stratigraphical division 
to mud symptoms and core measurements. 

MYUWI is the key to well's name (which is classified). 

stratigraphy:
contains 'STRATIGRAPHY_SYM' and 'LITHOLOGY' associated with 'TOP', 'BOTTOM' range.

lab_data:
contains 'MYUWI', 'POROSITY', 'PERMEABILITY', 'BITUMINS_EXTRACT', associated with 'DEPTH' value.

symptoms:
contains 'MYUWI', 'SYMPTOMS', 'GROUP', 'TYPE' associated with , 'START', 'STOP' depth range.
