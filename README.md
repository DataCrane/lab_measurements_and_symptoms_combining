+ median calculations and bar charts. 

.csv ARE DELETED DUE TO POTENTIAL ONWERSHIP CONSEQUENCES !! Short data order description below : 

MYUWI is the key. 

stratigraphy:
contains 'STRATIGRAPHY_SYM' and 'LITHOLOGY' associated with 'TOP', 'BOTTOM' range.

lab_data(core measurements):
contains 'MYUWI', 'POROSITY', 'PERMEABILITY', 'BITUMINS_EXTRACT', associated with 'DEPTH' value.

symptoms:
contains 'MYUWI', 'SYMPTOMS', 'GROUP', 'TYPE' associated with , 'START', 'STOP' depth range.
